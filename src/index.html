			<p class="mytext"> Huge thanks to Brad Traversy @ <a class="message-link" href="https://www.traversymedia.com/">TraversyMedia</a> for putting this lovely mindfulness / breathing app out there for all 
				to share. This app was created with a simple code along that Brad Traversy has put on <a class="message-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-1ZrU6avzI">YouTube</a>. A great resource for web developers if not the
				best (IMHO) out there like all his videos. My reason for duplicating the app was to use a stable working app as the start point and begin to bring in other technologies to refactor what was originally created. The plan was 
				to refactor the CSS with SASS and then use a task builder to build the necessary CSS & JS for the frontend using a task builder like Gulp. Plus also looking to include JQuery along the way. The overall goal 
				was to use technologies I've been introduced to but not properly worked with and by including them here get a better understanding of them through the simple process of using them.

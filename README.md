# Breathing Mindfulness App

A mindfulness/breathing app but meant as simple app I can play about / experiment with. I will use this app with other technologies to build 
and maintain it. Ultimatley the goal is to learn these other technologies through it.

Technologies (Goals) to include in the build and front end:

- Gulp Toolkit & Task Runner (Although overkill for this app just a basic understanding and use of Task building and SASS/LESS compiler) 
- SASS / LESS (Take the current CSS and refactor into CSS preprocessor. I'll compile with Gulp add on to create the CSS)
- JQuery (DOM manipulation for frontend UX)
